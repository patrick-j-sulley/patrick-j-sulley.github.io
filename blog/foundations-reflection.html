                        <h2 class="text-center">3 new things I've learnt about myself through core learning?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Firstly, the concept of neuroplasticity and how I can use that to work around
                            my natural learning limitations. Secondly, whenever I am in a situation where I need to
                            reflect back on what somebody has said to me (Listening & Looping), focusing on memorizing
                            key terms is a good strategy that I can employ whilst actively listening. Thirdly, ego wise,
                            I would say that the core learning confirmed to me that I am an open minded person who
                            operates on growth, being self-critical, and empathetic to others.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning & programming.
                        </h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Having a stable set of strong values allows you to be more certain of what
                            outcomes you are striving. I.e. if you have critical thinking as a core value, then you are
                            more likely to approach your learning and work with a troubleshooting strategy in order to
                            rule out outcomes that you find to not be the most efficient or logically sufficient.
                        </p>
                        <p id="post-text">Empathy in learning and programming relates to one's ability to work and
                            collaborate with others. A person with a strong empathetic mindset is more likely to work
                            well in a team based environment, as they are able to help contribute more to a friendly
                            setting that enables people to work comfortably.
                        </p>
                        <p id="post-text">Self-awareness allows you to identify your working style, your communication
                            style, and enables you to be constructively self-critical in order to identify areas that
                            you have the capacity to build upon and improve.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">What has surprised me the most about core learning?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">I would say that learning about neuroplasticity and how being able to use it
                            as a boosting element to a growth mindset. I have always understood that the developer
                            landscape is an ever-growing one, so having the correct mindset is crucial if you want to
                            keep up is important. But, learning about the inner workings of a scientific concept that
                            can help you knowingly work around your neurological limitations was very helpful for me to
                            uncover.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Most challenging aspects of core learning?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Some of the concepts touched upon, such as the aforementioned neuroplasticity,
                            can be difficult ones to practice and get comfortable with. Especially from the perspective
                            of someone with a neurological disorder that directly affects both my verbal and nonverbal
                            communication and learning skills. However, the payoff to the challenge at hand is valuable,
                            as learning techniques that directly build upon my natural barriers enables me to be a
                            better communicator and thinker.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Why do I think EDA focuses on core learning as much as they do?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Above all else, the target outcome of this bootcamp is to promote graduates
                            into the workforce, and the web development industry, like most team and office environment
                            based industries, is one that focuses on people skills over technical skills. Your ability
                            to work within a team of like-minded people is what ultimately sells you to an employer.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Does my time spent studying the core learning feel like a waste?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Not at all. Again, coming from somebody who is very open about their
                            neurological disorder and past with mental health issues, areas that build upon
                            non-technical skills are almost always helpful. Even for somebody not in my shoes, building
                            upon your people skills and your learning skills are ways that you can always make up for
                            shortcomings that you may feel like you have in your technical abilities.
                        </p>
