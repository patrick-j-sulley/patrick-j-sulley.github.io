                    <div id="post">
                        <p id="post-text">Positioning in HTML refers to the visually located placement of an element
                            within a web page via the defining positioning method that
                            has been specified. In non-technical terms, imagine a website that has a red square on it,
                            the position of that red square could be in the center of the page,
                            it could be at the top left, or the bottom right. The location of the image on the page is
                            dependent on what definition has been used to position it there.
                            By default, web elements will have a static position, which implies that it is rendered and
                            placed in the order that it is located within the HTML
                            (i.e. If the red square is after a title, and before a paragraph, that's where it will be
                            located by default)
                            There are three other definitions that I would like to look in to and explain here.
                            Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Relative</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Relative positioning, as stated in the name, defines the item as being
                            positioned relative to its default position within the page.
                            In the example we saw above, the staticly positioned red square existed at the very top left
                            corner of the page. This is because it is the very first item that item
                            that has been detected within the HTML to be displayed. If the position definition were to
                            be changed to Relative, this allows us to add further definitions
                            to move the red square around, with the default location now being a center point. The
                            example below shows a relative definiton of 10 pixels to the left, and 100 pixels
                            from the top of the default location.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">
                            <img src="../images/html-css-relative.JPG">
                        </div>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Absolute</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Absolute positioning, defines the item as being positioned in direct
                            comparison to the nearest ancestor element with either relative or absolute positioning.
                            In laymen's terms, if the red square exists within in a window that has been positioned
                            relative to its default location,
                            using the absolute position definition will locate it around that window as a center point.
                            This is because the window, based on its defition, is the nearest
                            ancestor element that has been detected on the page that matches this criteria. The example
                            here, shows that the red square
                            has detected the nearest non static acestor element as being a container that contains other
                            elements within it, so by using the same
                            10 pixel left and 100 pixel top definition from before, it positions it based on that
                            containers definitions.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">
                            <img src="../images/html-css-absolute.JPG">
                        </div>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Fixed</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Fixed positioning, defines the item as being positioned in a fixed area inside
                            the browser window. Unlike the previous two definitions, the
                            fixed definition doesn't rely on any other elements within the HTML to decide its location,
                            it refers to whatever the starting point of the web browser is for its center point. An easy
                            way to wrap your head around this, would be to imagine that you're looking at an artwork,
                            and
                            you want to know what it looks like with a sticker without ruining it, so you place the
                            sticker
                            on the glass case that the artwork exists within. The example that we see here, shows the
                            red square with the same
                            definitions as before, only this time, the position stays the exact same no matter how big
                            the browser window is.
