                        <p id="post-text">An anology that I like to use to describe the relationship between HTML, CSS,
                            and Javascript, is to think of a webpage as a coffee shop. The HTML of a web page can be
                            compared to the base structure and architecture of the coffee shop, the walls, floors,
                            windows, roof. The CSS is the outer style and interior design, such as the funiture, wall
                            paper, carpet, wall decor, and the painting on the outside. With both the HTML & CSS, we
                            have a nice looking coffee shop, but a coffee shop needs more to it in order to operate as a
                            proper establishment. The JavaScript in this instance, covers all the inner working parts
                            that help the coffee shop function, such as the barristas to take and serve orders, the
                            coffee machines to make the orders, the register to keep track of sales and profits, the
                            clocking system to record workers hours, the inventory management system to keep track of
                            and make new orders, etc..

                        <h2 class="text-center">Loops & Control Flow</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">In JavaScript, loops are a method to perform functions repeatedly based on the
                            type of loop it is (i.e. for, while, do/while). Control flow is the order that the computer
                            reads the code in to determine how it will perform functions, by default it will be read
                            from first line to last, however, there are keywords that can be used in order to change the
                            structure that the computer reads in. To explain this in a more digestable way, let's write
                            some psuedo-code based on the example of somebody who drinks 3 coffees a day and wants to
                            track
                            their daily intake in a journal.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">
                            <img src="../images/loop-coffee-journal.JPG">
                        </div>

                        </div>

                        <p id="post-text">Let's break this down. The loop here says that while the person has had
                            more than 0 cups of coffee today, they want to add it to their daily total. Every time there
                            is an addition to their daily total, they want to add an entry in their daily journal that
                            documents how many cups of coffee they have had today. However, let's then say that this
                            personal also wants to set a limit to how many cups of coffee they drink per day, and want
                            to remind themselves to not go over the limit. This is when control flow comes it to add a
                            break to our structure once that limit has been hit.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p id="post-text">With this addition, the previous loop of drink coffee then add to journal,
                            will
                            function as long as the daily total is less than the persons daily limit. However, if the
                            persons daily total is equal to their daily limit, then the control flow will shift to the
                            next part of the loop, where they will document in their journal a remainder that their
                            daily limit has been reached, and will stop drinking coffee for the day.

                        <h2 class="text-center">The DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">An analogy that could work for the DOM, is if we were to compare a web page to
                            an apple tree. Much like the tree holds all of the branches and each of the branches holds
                            apples, the DOM holds all of the objects on a webpage and seperates them based on identity.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">

                        </div>
                        <p id="post-text">The DOM, much like the apple tree allows us to visualize, interact with, and
                            modify each of the objects that it contains. An example of how we may interact with the DOM,
                            would be to use a JavaScript loop as previously discussed above, to check for any objects
                            that were added under a date that we no longer want to display on the web page, and then
                            make them
                            invisible. Similiar to how with the apple tree, we want to pick any apples from it that have
                            past their expirary date and dispose of them.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Arrays & Objects</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">In JavaScript, an object is a piece of data that can store multiple unique
                            properties, an Array is a type of object that has the capacity of storing other objects,
                            including all of their individual properties. The properties of both objects and arrays can
                            be accessed and modified. An anology that can be used here is if we think of the array as a
                            binder, where we can classify the binder as an object that has to capacity to store many
                            other objects within, which in this case would be documents. Let's also write up some pseudo
                            code to show this in a code format.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">

                        </div>
                        <p id="post-text">Here, we see that in the code format, the binder object has been created, and
                            within the square brackets, are each of the document objects. Now, let's say that we want to
                            access a document from this binder. In the code example, we need to declare which specific
                            document it is that we would like to access from the binder array. Because array objects are
                            counted from 0 upwards, if we want to select the 1st document in the binder, in our code we
                            need to specify the object in the array that is identified by 0.
                        </p>
                        <div id="avatar">
                            <img src="../images/array-objects-example2.JPG">
                        </div>
                        <p id="post-text">After specifying the document that we want from our binder, we can inspect the
                            specific attributes of it as we need. In code format, this could be the date that the
                            document was published, in which we would not need to specify that property in the same way
                            as the array object, we could specific it as "currentDocument.date". This is because there
                            can only be one unique property called 'date' in the document object, whereas the binder
                            array object could thearetically have multiple document objects that have the same name, so
                            it relies on the numbered order that the document objects are organised in to identity them.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Functions</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">In JavaScript, a function is a piece of code that has been set up to perform a
                            specific task that can retrieve and return values. An anology that I will use for this, is
                            that of a balance scale. A balance scale has both a right side and a left side that are both
                            purposed for holding items. The scale will then detect the weight of both items and will
                            then showcase which panel has the heavier weight to it. Let's also take a look at this in
                            psuedo-code to get an idea of what this would
                            look like as a function.

                        <p id="post-text">If we break this down, we have essentially replicated the basic function of
                            the balance scale in psuedo-code. The function takes in a left panel and a right panel, it
                            checks if the weight property of the left panel is greater than the weight property, and it
                            will then return the left panel as the heavier panel if that is indeed the case. If not, it
                            will then perform the same calculation to the right panel and return that if it's the case.
                            Otherwise, if both weigh the same, neither are the heavier panel and no value putting one
                            over the other can be returned.
