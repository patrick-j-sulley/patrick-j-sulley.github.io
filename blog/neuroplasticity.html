                            understanding the principles of neuroplasticity, you are able to improve both the speed and
                            efficiency in your learning as you will configure your neural networks to much more easily
                            work with whatever related task at hand you are attending to.

                        <p id="post-text">In the context of the foundations and the bootcamp, I plan to engage with
                            these principles through both physically and mentally immersing myself in my code in a
                            number of different ways. (i.e. Using breakpoints and analyzing the focused line of code to
                            understand the purposed functionality, physically writing any example code given or found in
                            order to build upon muscle memory etc..)

                        <p id="post-text"> Practicing through Repetition. Relating newly observed information and
                            contextualizing it in different ways. Consistent reminders that the capacity of knowledge is
                            not limited, and not knowing something doesn't equal not being able to know something.

                        <h3 class="text-center">What is it? Why is it Relevant?</h3>
                        <p id="post-text">Growth mindset is the idea that knowledge is ever expanding through a
                            lifetime. New habits, new information, new abilities, new techniques, new skills can all be
                            learnt and obtained. A fixed mindset implies that the current capacity of knowledge that one
                            has is incapable of being grown. As a developer, having the perspective that you can always
                            learn more, is a very strong mindset to have, as the development world is ever expanding,
                            and the ability to stay engaged and to keep up is an important asset.
                        </p>

                        <p id="post-text">This exploration didn't surprise me, as employing this mindset throughout my
                            learning over the years has helped me in a great manner. The evidence of this, for me, is
                            seeing how I learnt prior to this mindset, compared to my learning after.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center">Integration</h3>
                        <p id="post-text">To put it simply. Through researching and questioning out of the interest of
                            growth, rather than out of perceived confusion or lack of knowledge. A resource that I found
                            very useful for learning about the integration of a growth mindset can be found <a

                        <p id="post-text">Over the years, through the application of employing a growth mindset, I have
                            learnt and applied methods to address my natural learning and communication barriers that
                            are symptoms of my Asperger's. I will continue to apply this mindset when it comes to my
                            learning and communicating at EDA.

                        <p id="post-text">With my long term career goal of being a remote based developer in mind, I
                            intend to grow as comfortable as possible working from home as possible in order to achieve
                            maximum efficiency within that environment.
                        </p>
                        <p id="post-text">In order to meet my goal of finetuning my communication style, I intend to
                            practice talking to my fellow students and facilitators, and to seek feedback on my
                            communication abilities when possible. Practicing through repetition.

                        <p id="post-text">In relation to coding, both neuroplasticity and a growth mindset will be
                            incredible relevant. Building up muscle memory for the process of typing coding is
                            important, as is gaining outside perspective through asking for help or feedback from team
                            members when you ask them to look at your code. A growth based mindset removes the
                            intimidation of approaching newer technologies and languages within web development, and
                            enables you to increase your portfolio/experiences, leading to more potential job
                            opportunities later down the road.
