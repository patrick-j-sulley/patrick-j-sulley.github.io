                        <h2 class="text-center">Long term goal/Career pathway</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">
                            My long term goal throughout my journey down this career pathway, is to
                            eventually become a full time remote full stack web/software developer. We have learnt that
                            throughout COVID, industries that are primarily based in the digital landscape have the
                            capability to operate at near or even full capacity on a work from home basis. The benefits
                            of the remote approach to a profession have always interested me, such as the freedom of
                            living in a location of choice over one of a closer distance to my workplace, the removal of
                            the time investment of travelling to and from an office every day resulting in more free
                            time to pursue other ambitions and interests, and the luxury of working in my own
                            comfortable space. During bootcamp, I want to develop a
                            full palette of both front and back end skills, as I would like to leave EDA
                            where potential creative output has been increased to a level where I can be relied upon to
                            merge into
                            any development team and contribute in a big way. I also see myself reaching a point where I
                            take my experiences and knowledge after a long and ambitious career, and pass that down to
                            the next generation in the form of teaching, as I believe in giving back and take great
                            pleasure at seeing those that I have taken under my wing grow and flourish. Destination
                            wise, I would like to start off my career within the Wellington region, as I think the
                            developer community based here is very collaborative and tightly knit. Long term, I would
                            like to potentially explore the world and work internationally.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Strengths/Limitations in bootcamp</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">I am very skilled in getting into a routine and isolating my focus on a
                            particular subject and seeing that through until the very end. If I am given a set of tasks
                            to achieve, I become immersed in those tasks and fully dedicate myself to make it through
                            all the obstacles that come along the way. I love working within teams and establishing a
                            strong collaborative workflow through the building of good rapport that ensures everyone is
                            comfortable and in it to see everybody involved succeed.

                            My limitations involve natural learning barriers that have come alongside my neurological
                            condition, such as verbal & non verbal communication issues, misinterpretation of
                            information, and delays in my development. These are areas that for the most part I have the
                            ability to work through, but as they come naturally to me, there will be times where they
                            can take over my learning process without me noticing. Other limitations include my
                            hesitancy to ask for help when needed in times of which Iâ€™m struggling, as well as my
                            forgetfulness to give myself a break or to take time away from my learning when I need to
                            recover.

                            Throughout foundations, these strengths and limitations have mostly remained the same.
                            Entering bootcamp, I see myself still being able to forge myself a routine that enables me
                            to isolate my focus in any tasks I have been given, and throughout working with my cohart
                            during foundations, I've fortunately been able to retain my ability to build good rapport
                            with my colleagues and establish a very friendly and collaborative work environment.
                            Limitations wise, I have been actively working on reducing my overall hesitancy to asking
                            others for help, as I have had no shame in getting assistance from my fellow cohart members
                            whenever I have been stuck. My natural learning and communication barriers still remain, but
                            I have the mindset required to work through them adequetely.

                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Non technical/Human skills I would like to develop at EDA</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">I want to finetune my communication style so that I am as clear and concise as
                            possible, as I have the tendency to go into too much detail and to repeat myself
                            unnecessarily. I want to ensure that my work schedule is as balanced within a day to day
                            basis as possible (i.e. Reduce the amount of work that is left until the last minute). I
                            would also like to learn how to sell myself and what I have to offer in the best way
                            possible to an employer.

                            Heading into bootcamp, I will continue to work on combatting my limitations, such as
                            clarifying information that I am not 100% certain of the meaning of, by asking for help when
                            oppurtunity presents itself. I would still very much like to finetune my communication to
                            avoid my natural tendency to ramble and repeat myself. Improving my self awareness and
                            reflective skills would also be very advantagous, as I can often get lost in my work and
                            forget to reflect and give myself recovery time when necessary.

                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Expectations of the bootcamp team</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Based on my conversation with members of the team at this stage,
                            I have the expectation that they will respond to any difficulties I am facing with empathy
                            and compassion, and that they will work alongside me to help me work through the obstacles I
                            am facing. I also have the expectation that they provide me feedback & constructive
                            criticism in areas
                            where I need to improve, so that I can immediately identify where I need to step up and take
                            action. Entering bootcamp, these are still the expectations I have.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Expectations on myself in Bootcamp</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">I will managed my workload in a proactive and productive manner, in which I
                            will stay engaged, work hard, seek help when I need it, give help to my fellow students when
                            they need it, give myself the appropriate balance of work/leisure to reduce burnout,
                            maintain a high level of attendance, be very communicative with my peers and the bootcamp
                            team, and most importantly, enjoy myself. I also will carry the expectation that I jump up
                            for any community oppurtunites to begin networking myself and meeting people within the
                            industry.
