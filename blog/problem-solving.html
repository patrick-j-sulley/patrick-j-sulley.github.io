                            In this scenario, I was required to write code that passed a set of pre-configured tests
                            that checked to see if correct values were being passed through my functions (JS Kata -
                            Gradebook for my fellow students). In laymens terms, this would be like if I needed my car
                            to pass a warrent of fitness and each part of the car was tested. The test in this
                            particular scenario that I was stuck on, required me to add a score to a student
                            gradebook under the name of 'Susan', with a score of 80. However, I got stuck on this,
                            as despite calling to the function and passing through the correct values,
                            I was not passing the test.

                            I did a bit of googling to make sure that I wrote up the call to the function correctly,
                            which I had indeed done right. I tried swapping the function around in my
                            code to see if it was an issue of sequencing, that hadn't changed my outcome. I read through
                            the error messages multiple times, but was confused as I was certain that
                            I had done it correctly. I had also attempted to console log (In laymens terms, console
                            logging is like writing down your working process for a math question on a test) the
                            gradebook itself to check
                            the values of it before and after the addScore function was called, and found that the value
                            was being added, despite the fact that I still wasn't passing the test. It wasn't until I
                            read further down the code, in the area where all the tests had been configured, where I
                            discovered that
                            this call to the function had already been written out before hand. The test itself checked
                            to see if the gradebook had an exact number of entries, and because this function had been
                            called to twice, the gradebook had received more than 1 entry. After removing the call to
                            the function that I put in myself, the test passed as expected.

                            I felt mostly confused throughout the process, as I was absolutely certain that I had
                            written what was required. I was even more stumped when the usual problem solving techniques
                            that I had found reliable within my prior coding experience hadn't lead me to a solution.

                            The most important takeaway that I had obtained from this experience, was that it is
                            important to read through all of the code you are working with beforehand, especially if the
                            code that you are working with was written by somebody else. A simple oversight on my part,
                            of not checking all of the code, had lead to a half hour stumble of confusion, that I could
                            have easily avoided had I taken the short time before I started working to read through what
                            I was assigned to work on.

                            Another scenario from the JS Kata section (Super FizzBuzz, this time). This time, we were
                            required to set up 2 functions, 'FizzBuzz' and 'Super FizzBuzz'. The FizzBuzz function takes
                            a number and either returns the number, or, a result if it is a multiple of a specified
                            number. If the number is a multiple of
                            3, it returns the word 'Fizz', if a multiple of 5, it returns the word 'Buzz', and if a
                            multiple of 15, it returns the word 'FizzBuzz'. An anology to help understand this, could be
                            that of a raffle, where you want every ticket number that is a multiple of 3 to be for a
                            minor prize, 5 for a medium, and 15 for a large.
                        </p>
                        <p id="post-text">
                            The Super_FizzBuzz function here, is to return the same results, however, rather than taking
                            in singular numbers, it takes in a array of numbers and checks for the value of each one in
                            the array before returning either the number or a result based on what it is a multiple of.
                            So, compared to the previous raffle scenario, this time, we're calculating multiple tickets
                            at a time. The problem that I needed to resolve here, was to work out how to automate this
                            process, as the testing required the Super_FizzBuzz function to work on arrays of any size.

                        <p id="post-text">
                            Initially, I tried to copy and paste the functionality of the original fizz buzz and
                            replicate the checks but with an arrays values, which didn't end up working, as the code
                            within the original function just checks singular numbers without breaking them down in the
                            array. I then typed in some Pseudocode to better get an idea of the sequencing that I would
                            need to implement in order to achieve this, to which, I worked out that the right approach
                            would be to check for how many numbers were in the array, and for each number, pass it
                            through to the original FizzBuzz function and collect each returned number to be put into an
                            array that is then returned from the Super_FizzBuzz function. My next technique was to do
                            some googling around, which lead me to some StackOverflow pages that had similiar examples
                            to what I was trying to achieve, which I could then work off of and implement in my example
                            here.

                            My main takeaway from this instance of problem solving, was that planning out what you are
                            trying to achieve with your code, before googling, is a great way of reducing the time load
                            required to find the information that you are seeking. Had I not structured what I was
                            trying to achieve with Pseudocode, it's likely that I could have spent a lot more time

                            I found pseudocode very helpful in particular with the Super_FizzBuzz scenario described
                            above. It's very similiar to brainstorming on a piece of paper before researching for a
                            report, as it essentially structures the goals and objectives that you are wanting to
                            achieve with a piece of code that you are wanting to write out.

                            This is almost always my first approach when it comes to problem solving, as it allows me to

                            the bat. It's important to not spend too much time just trying for the sake of trying, as it
                            can be easy to go on pure auto pilot without trying other methods as well.

                            Similiar to Pseudocode, it allows you to lay out what you are wanting to achieve, by
                            breaking everything down metaphorically and making comparisons to different scenarios and

                            A crucial requirement as a developer, is being able to communicate and work within a team
                            based environment. This includes not just the ability to collaberate, but also, the ability
                            to ask for assistance when needed. In my prior experience, working within a development team
                            in a work based environment, it was encouraged that I, as a junior developer, get assistance
                            from the senior developer as soon as I needed it. A development team is very much a machine,
                            and if one of those cogs slows down, it can slow down the entire process.

                            minds, as we are forgetful creatures. This is why I have always ensured to take down notes
                            of whatever I have been doing, as there have been times where I have reffered back to notes
                            taken years way back, as a way for me to recall my thought process from past experiences as
                            a way to help myself in the present.
