                    <div id="post">
                        <p id="post-text">My personal identity is one that is built out of growth. I have dealt with a
                            number of personal struggles and mental health issues in my life. A diagnosis of asperger’s
                            syndrome at a very young age led to a childhood full of communication issues with my peers.
                            Struggles with depression, anxiety and morbid obesity in my teen years resulted in my
                            dropping out of high school at 16. These hard times that I went through, required a lot of
                            hard work and an immense level of motivation to build myself up out of. </p>

                        <p id="post-text">This long and
                            proactive stage of growth that I went through, combined with me growing up in a very loving
                            and close knit family & community based culture, led to me developing values centered around
                            openness, transparency, kindness, empathy and understanding that people are most often
                            products of their own experience and environment. Because of what I went through at a young
                            age, I strive to help contribute to positive changes in other people's lives. Outside of the
                            aforementioned, I consider myself to be an enthusiastic, yet laid back individual, that is
                            cooperative, talkative, friendly, and humorous. In order to ensure that this isn’t just a
                            self reflection, I also asked both a friend of 10 years, and my brother for their
                            perspective on my identity and values.</p>

                        <p id="post-text">My friend summarised me with a few talking points, “cool, calm, collected.”,
                            “strong sense
                            of justice”, “understands the importance of being well read on the experiences of others,
                            and current affairs within the world”, “very kind, selfless and empathetic”, and “soft and
                            well spoken.”</p>

                        <p id="post-text">My brother, whom I have been very close to for my entire life, and somebody
                            who I have based
                            my personality and sense of humour off of, had a few stories and past experiences to relay.

                        <p id="post-text"><i>“In terms of values and how they relate to real life stories then, I've
                                always respected
                                your critical thinking skills and how you translate that towards calmly and eloquently
                                handling yourself and representing your particular viewpoint during discussions and
                                debates.
                                I.E basically every time you talked about covid and topics relating to it during the
                                pandemic.

                                I've also always admired your strong sense of determination and willpower, and ability
                                to
                                tap into those resources to overcome seemingly insurmountable and often daunting
                                problems
                                and issues even over long periods of time. When others I know, even including myself,
                                would
                                find it very hard to do so.

                                Coupled with the forward thinking and proactive rather than reactive methods you usually
                                employ to resolve those aforementioned problems. Rather than waiting for solutions to
                                fall
                                into your lap, you usually do your darndest to fix them yourself”</i></p>

                        </h2>
                        <p id="post-text">In recent years, as I have grown into a more empathetic person, I’ve developed
                            more progressive views that have shaped me into who I am today.

                            While I aim to be as understanding and as friendly towards my peers as possible, I have had
                            to stand up against certain stances/views from those within my circle that are potentially
                            hurtful/misunderstanding towards other friends of mine that are a part of marginalized
                            communities. I aim to conduct my counterpoints in a calm and neutral manner in order to
                            ensure that the person in question knows that whilst I disagree with what they’ve said, I am
                            attacking the perspective and not them as a person.

                            In today's political landscape, discussions centered around this area can result in friction
                            and division, especially when talking to those who have viewpoints from the opposite side of
                            the spectrum as you do.

                            While most of my conversations around these topics remain civil and no love is lost, there
                            have been times where I’ve stood my ground in what I see as being morally and ethically
                            right, and have ended up needing to cut off contact when somebody disagrees in these areas
                            to an extreme degree. I see this as a necessary consequence, not just for the sake of my own
                            mental well being, but to also provide safer circles for my friends that I stand up for to
                            participate in.

                        </h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Overall, I’m a product of my upbringing and experiences. Whether that be the
                            good values that I built up out of admiration and inspiration towards the wonderful people I
                            am fortunate to call my friends/family within my life, or the empathetic nature I have
                            towards other people in tough situations that I built up as a result of experiencing my own
                            hardships.

                            My strong sense of collaboration and community is strongly connected to the polish heritage
                            on my mothers side of the family. Growing up, no matter the physical distance between
                            family, we would always aim to be together on the most wonderful time of the year,
                            Christmas.

                            Specifically, we would celebrate christmas under polish traditions, where christmas eve is
                            seen as the most important day, which is called Wigilia. Wigilia is the Christmas eve
                            supper, with an absence of red meat, replaced with fish, and an extra seat left at the
                            dinner table for an unexpected guest. Experiencing tradition on a year-to-year basis, taught
                            me the benefits of a continuous event that tightly knits family and community together.

                            Outside of tradition. Growing up in New Zealand has shaped my values and identity as well.
                            Being brought up in a multicultural country where people from all around the globe have
                            congregated and share the values that they have learnt has taught me the value of accepting
                            and embracing all different kinds of backgrounds. Not to mention, the casual and laid back
                            attitude of Kiwi’s has strongly resonated with my sense of humour, and my ability to appear
                            as approachable as possible.

                        <h5 class="text-center">Learning & Career Development</h5>
                        <p id="post-text">My strengths in these areas include my determination to work my way up and to
                            see the results of my hard work all the way to the very end, as well as my ability to be
                            self critical and analyse the areas of which I can improve upon. My character elements of
                            being talkative and enthusiastic also play to my advantage when it comes to selling myself
                            and creating a friendly environment around me.

                            My limitations come from the natural communication barriers and perception difficulties that
                            are symptoms of my asperger’s, which have the tendency to pop up unnoticed. I have worked
                            hard over the years, through the attendance and completion of multiple communication
                            courses, to learn techniques and methods that allow me to work around these, but there will
                            still be times where I can fall back into these behaviours unnoticed.

                        <p id="post-text">Strengths of mine that would help in my learning journey, outside of the
                            aforementioned motivative and determinative traits, would include my empathy and desire to
                            help those around me succeed. Especially in programming, where having the ability to assist
                            others and speed their progress along, helps you in turn learn the material more from your
                            own perspective.

                        <h5 class="text-center">Work Resistance & Tension
                        </h5>
                        <p id="post-text">An instance of where I was more empathetic than open towards others in my
                            environment, stems from a day during my software development internship, where I was trying
                            to achieve a task for the entire day, but to no success.

                            My mistake out of empathy was my reluctance to ask the in-house senior developer for help,
                            because I thought they were busy and did not want to be disturbed. After they had noticed I
                            wasn’t making much progress on the current sprint, they took a look at me working, and
                            offered to help. They then said something that stuck with me, “We’re a team, if you ask for
                            help, it helps me and the rest of the team.

                            In this situation, the resistance was from me, and resulted in my misinterpretation of what
                            being ‘productive’ was in a working environment. The strategy that I began to employ after
                            that point was to be openly communicative about my work progress as much as possible, and to
                            invite open communication from others who may have entered a learning or work environment
                            feeling the same way I did.
