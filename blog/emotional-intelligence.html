                        <h2 class="text-center">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Emotional Intelligence is a methodology that covers the areas of knowledge
                            that one has regarding
                            the recognition, control, evaluation and expression of emotions in both themselves, and
                            other people that they interact with. This can be used to improve the identification of
                            emotions, evaluating how other people are feeling, the management and balancing of one's own
                            emotions, determining the best response to how other people are feeling, fabricating the
                            right balance of emotions in one's social communication, and finding the best way to relate
                            to other people.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">Intelligence quotient, unlike emotional intelligence, prioritises and focuses
                            on areas that relate to ones knowledge over areas such as visual and spatial processing,
                            information about the world, the fluidity of their reasoning, memory capacity in both short
                            term and working categories, and quantitative reasoning. When we typically think of
                            intelligence, we think of how smart someone is, rather than how good of a communicator they
                            are. This is what usually seperates the 2 concepts, as a good communicator doesn't
                            necessarily have to be the most knowledable in what they're discussing, and one who is well
                            verse in their field of expertise isn't always a strong communicator.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Why is it important?</h2>
                        <p id="post-text">The importance of emotional intelligence are the net benefits that it provides
                            in different categories of emotional dialogue and processing. On a personal level, it can
                            help bring stability to one's
                            management of their own emotions. On an interpersonal level, it greatly improves ones
                            communication skills through the identification of other people's emotions and allows one to
                            improve their relationships with other people through empatheticly evaluated responses. On a
                            business/academic scale, emotional intelligence is key to establishing a safe and healthy
                            environment
                            amongst colleagues and clients. Emotional intelligence is also a desirable trait to have for
                            one who finds themselves in a leadership role, as they can much more easily manage both
                            their emotions, as well as their workforces. Overall, EQ is a valuble resource, as we are
                            all human at the end of the day, and humans are social beings. Therefore, mastering an asset
                            such
                            as EQ that analyses, investigates, and responds to human emotional dialouge, will provide
                            you with a skillset that has the potential to exceed that of purely IQ alone.
